# TheArchive.Core

The library that handles all the fun things like ...
* registering custom `Features` that can be toggled on or off mid-game.
* creating menus and buttons for your `Features`.
* saving custom settings cross-profile.

> [!NOTE]  
> This ***only adds the mod settings menu itself***,  
> no extra features are included.

## In Game Mod Settings

An in-game mod settings menu for easy feature customization.  
Most Features are toggleable mid-game and some even have extra options to mess with!
