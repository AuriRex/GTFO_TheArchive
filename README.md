# TheArchive

A massive mod for the game [GTFO](https://gtfothegame.com/), that adds a ton of Quality of Life and cosmetic features to the game without overstepping the games original design.

Not only compatible with the **latest release** on steam but also with many of the **older GTFO builds**, tested on all of the latest patches for each (old) rundown.  
Additionally this mod is trying to preserve older versions by keeping them playable even once the servers are gone forever **by handling all playfab requests locally** and saving things like **progression/level completions**, **boosters** and **vanity items** onto your storage device of choice for old versions.

## What this does
Improve the game via Quality of Life and cosmetic additions without disrupting the experience of other players.  
All mechanics are still kept vanilla and in spirit of the games original design.

## What this **doesn't** do
This ***does not*** give you access to the game or any of the old versions, you have to have bought the game on steam!  
This ***does not*** give any player an unfair advantage or trivialize the game, you have to bring your own skill.

## Status
This project is in a Beta state at the moment, overall it's pretty stable but expect some bugs and unfinished features.  

If you encounter any bugs while playing with mods installed make sure to remove your mods first and reproduce the issue without any installed before asking the games devs for support.

# Features

## In Game Mod Settings

An in-game mod settings menu for easy feature customization.  
Most Features are toggleable mid game and some even have extra options to mess with!

</p>

## Discord Rich presence

Fully customizable Discord Rich Presence system to show others what you're up to.  
(currently only configurable through the config file)

![Rich Presence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37329066/190882400-4be7c531-f863-4c3b-a703-34020f579aad.png)

## Settings Redirect

Game settings get saved to a different location for every Rundown so you only have to change them once*.  
(*for each major version once, a version agnostic settings menu is on the TODO list)

Having to redo your settings whenever you switch to another Rundown is now a thing of the past.

## Re-Added Old Hammers - `[R6 - RL]`

All 4 of the old, pre rundown 6 melee weapons, are back:  
Maul, Gavel, Mallet and Sledge can be enabled in the mod settings menu and will be added to the melee weapons menu on the loadout screen.

## Local Rundown Progression
This allows you to save your progress (including boosters and vanity items) onto your computers hard drive instead of depending on the developers servers.  
The implementation should be as close to the original game whenever a specific (rundown) version was live, to keep the experience genuine even after servers are down forever.

### Glass Liquid System Override

Change the resolution of the system that renders the blood splatters and other liquids on your visor or disable it entirely.

### Disable UI Mirroring

# Installation

The mod is available for both MelonLoader and BepInEx (R2ModMan).  
The BepInEx version is a little behind currently but will be updated in the future - not every feature is currently available on this version!

## Using MelonLoader

1. Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader#how-to-use-the-installer) into your game folder.  
   Make sure to install **MelonLoader version `0.5.7`**, not anything older or newer (for now!)
2. **Launch the game once to generate files & folders** and once in the main menu close it again.  
   (This could take a little longer the first time around)
3. Download the latest mod version from [here](https://github.com/AuriRex/GTFO_TheArchive/releases/latest). (it's called `TheArchive.Core.dll`)
4. Put the dll into the `Mods` folder inside of your GTFO directory  
   (In Steam: `[Right Click on GTFO]` > `[Manage >]` > `[Browse local files]`)
5. Launch the game again, you're done!  
   (Check if the mod is installed by navigating to the games `Settings` menu, there should be a button labeled `Mod Settings` in the bottom left.)

## Using BepInEx / R2MM

1. Create a Profile in R2MM and install the `GTFO BepInEx Pack`
2. Download the `EXPERIMENTAL_BepInEx_Ar_v?.?.??.zip` from the bottom of the [releases page here](https://github.com/AuriRex/GTFO_TheArchive/releases/latest).
3. In R2ModMan, go to the `Settings > Profile` tab
4. Click the `Import local mod` button  
5. Open the downloaded zip file via the `Select file` button and following file picker.
6. You're done, it should now appear in the `Installed` tab.

---

# Where are my saves?

By default, all mod files get saved to `%appdata%/../LocalLow/GTFO_TheArchive/`.  
Most things like progression, boosters and vanity get saved into the `SaveData` folder inside of the previous mentioned one, neatly divided into rundown specific folders.  
The location of this `SaveData` folder can be customized by editing `TheArchive_Settings.json`'s `"CustomFileSaveLocation"` property to point to any location of your choosing. (Cloud storage like GoogleDrive, Dropbox, etc ..., recommended)  
(*Make sure to escape backslashes (`\`) in your path by doubling them (like this: `\\`), else it won't work!*)

# Technical stuffs

## Building the project (On Windows)

### Step 1 (using MelonLoader)
In order to fully build the MelonLoader version of the mod, both latest **AND** Rundown 3 game files are required.
* Latest Game Version
    * Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) and run the game once
    * Copy the `MelonLoader` folder from the game directory into `_R_LATEST/`
* R3 (steam manifest: `1993854016152145129`)
    * Obtain the last Rundown 3 build, install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) and run the game once.
    * Copy the `MelonLoader` folder from the game directory into `_R_RD003/`
    * Create a folder called `GTFO_Data` inside of `_R_RD003/`
    * Copy the `Managed` folder from the game directory `GTFO/GTFO_Data/Managed/` into the `_R_RD003/GTFO_Data/` folder

#### Folder structure (MelonLoader)
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ _R_LATEST/                              # Latest Version Assemblies go here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MelonLoader/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Managed/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Accessibility.dll
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Addons-ASM.dll
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ MelonLoader.dll
â”œâ”€â”€ _R_RD003/                               # Rundown 3 Assemblies go here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GTFO_Data/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Managed/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Accessibility.dll
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Addons-ASM.dll
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MelonLoader/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ MelonLoader.dll
â””â”€â”€ .../                                    # Other Project Folders / Files
```

### Step 1 (using BepInEx)
The BepInEx release is only supported on the latest game version.
* Install BepInEx either manually or create a new profile in R2MM and install `GTFO BepInEx Pack`
* Make sure to launch the game (or profile) once and let IL2CPPInterop generate the proxy assemblies
* Open the game (or profile) folder and copy the `BepInEx` folder into this projects `_R_LATEST/` folder
* After opening the solution make sure to switch from `R_ML` to `R_BIE` in the menu bar to target BepInEx

#### Folder structure (BepInEx)
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ _R_LATEST/                              # Latest Version Assemblies go here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BepInEx/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ interop/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Accessibility.dll
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Addons-ASM.dll
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ core/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ BepInEx.Core.dll
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ .../                                    # Other Project Folders / Files
```

### Step 2: Building
1. Open the solution `TheArchive.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Hit `CTRL + Shift + B` on your keyboard or alternatively use the `Build > Build Solution` menubar option
3. The project is now building and the final dll is going to be placed into the `out/` directory

## Building the project (On Linux)

Have fun, you'll figure it out.
