# TheArchive

A [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) based [GTFO](https://gtfothegame.com/) mod that's aiming to preserve older versions by keeping them playable even once the servers are gone forever **by handling all playfab requests locally** and saving things like **progression/level completions**, **boosters** and **vanity items** onto your storage device of choice.

(Also includes a few Quality of life tweaks, which are toggleable)
