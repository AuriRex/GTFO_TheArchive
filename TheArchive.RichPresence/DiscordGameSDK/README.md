# Discord Rich Presence

Huge shoutouts to [Lachee](https://github.com/Lachee) for her re-implementation of the discord_game_sdks functions in C#!

[Original Repo](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp)

The dll included here is a modified version ([Source here](https://github.com/AuriRex/discord-rpc-csharp)) that switches the Newtonsoft.Json dependency to use Clonesoft.Json instead. (Which is essentially the same thing, just in a renamed namespace.)
