### Glass Liquid System Override

Change the resolution of the system that renders the blood splatters and other liquids on your visor or disable it entirely.  
Disabling the system entirely prevents/"fixes" the so called "Void Bug" from happening, where sometimes a blob of darkness, the big black blob consumes your entire screen, making you unable to see anything for a few seconds up to minutes at a time.

### Glowsticks!

Change the base color to any of the available ones (Green, Yellow, Orange or Red) which syncs to other players!  
And/Or override the color locally (for yourself only) based on one fixed color or based on who threw the glowstick.

### Loading Indicator

Displays a little indicator that shows if other players have finished loading yet.

### Nickname

Change your name in game, includes a color option.

### Player Color Override

Allows you to change the colors of you and your teammates.  
Additionally allows you to colorize other players based on their nickname color.

### 99% Reload Fix

Fixes the bug that leaves you with one bullet short in the mag even though enough ammo is available.

### L4D Style Resource Packs

Use left and right mouse buttons to apply resource packs instead of `E`  
Left mouse = yourself  
Right mouse = other players (can be held down + hovered over a player to start the interaction)

### Disable Hud Sway

Makes the in-game hud stay in place while running, jumping and looking around.

### Disable UI Mirroring

Removes the mirroring effect on UI elements.

### Disable UI Parallax

Stops the movement of UI elements in menu screens (Loadout, Rundown, ...) whenever you move your cursor around.  
(Some elements might get partially or fully cut off-screen!)

### No Dead Pings

Fixes pings (red triangles, doritos) staying on dead enemies as a result of high ping.

### Remove Story Dialog

Prevents all level-based voice events that have subtitles assigned from playing.  
(Goodbye Schaefer & Co ðŸ˜¥)

### Skip Elevator Animation

Automatically skips the cutscene after initiating a cage drop.  
This leads to faster load times as the game only starts building the level once the cutscene is over.

### Bot Customization

Customize your Bots appearance as host and change their names. (Syncs to other players!)

### Process Priority

Automatically change the games process priority, potentially increasing performance by a tiny bit.
